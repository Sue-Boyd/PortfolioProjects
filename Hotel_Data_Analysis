-- Combine tables into one unified dataset and create a temp table to query data from all tables

with hotels as (
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

-- Is the hotel revenue growing by year?  In order to see this, a new column was created by adding together the stays_in_weekend_nights column and the stays_in_week_nights column.  
-- The statement is multiplied by the adr (daily rate) and renamed to "revenue" to give it an alias
-- Group by the arrival_date_year,sum, and round the totals in order to see if revenue is increasing by year
-- Per the stakeholder's request, the data needs to also be broken down by hotel type so the hotel column was added in order to achieve this

select 
arrival_date_year,
hotel,
round(sum((stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights) *adr), 2) as revenue 
from hotels
group by arrival_date_year, hotel
